# UnityARKitFaceGestures
An example repository created to demonstrate how to track gestures with ARKit and Unity3d

* To setup an expression go to the project tab in Unity3d > Right Click on any folder > Expressions > Create Expression
* Name the expression
* Increment the Size of "Blend Shape Ranges" to add a new face area to track
* Set the Lower and Upper Bounds
* Associate new expression with the Expression Manager "Expression Configurations" increment the size of the array to add a new expression association

If you have questions about this feel free to watch the YouTube video below where I go through this process in detail:
